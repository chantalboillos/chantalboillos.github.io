<h1 style="color: white; font-size: 40px; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px"> Welcome to the my story page!  ↓↓↓</h1>

<h5 style="font-size: 27px">Why?</h5>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">The reason why I created this website was to help anyone who's struggling with the fact that they are feeling excluded from their community or that they just find it complicated to stay engaged or inside a conversation. It's a fact that some people find it really hard to feel included in a conversation, this can be in any type of context, it can be in a conversation, in their community,  in their friend group, a neighborhood group, a workgroup, etc. I know this from first-hand experience which is why I wouldn't wish this upon anyone and I just wanted to create a website so people can feel more at home, they can feel more comfortable, and hopefully, I can help them develop skills that will help them include themselves in those conversations or communities or whatever it is they have to include themselves in. This is because It's a fact that if they don't include themselves nobody's going to include them and you always must put yourself first. From a very young age I myself have experienced social rejection as I have been constantly moving schools due to my mother's work, it has always been hard for me to make friends but throughout the years I develop strategies that have helped me, and by making this website I hope that it helps as many people as I can reach and really do wish I can help you in any situation in life with my tips. Overall I just really want to help people and make sure that they don't struggle with exclusion in their communities or friend groups or whatever it is once again that they feel excluded from. These are just basic human rights.</p>

<h5 style="font-size: 27px">How?</h5>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">I created this website for school purposes, but it has always been my dream to impact people's lives, and my school has given me the chance to do this by actually making it into a school project. I created this website by using HTML coding which is a form of coding where you pretty much just code the entire website yourself and choose the colors and choose the style, the font, everything was designed by me in order for it to have my own personal touch. It was a way to express myself as well as sharing the tips I have for people. It was a pretty tiring process as I had so much work to do, but I know it was all worth it because now I'll be able to help so many people and hopefully impact their lives in the best way possible. Whenever I come up with a new tipI will write it down so more people can have access to it and then once again hopefully improve the way they feel included in their communities or conversations or whatever they feel they need to be included in through the use of my tips.
