<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
To include yourself in your community, first, you need to know how to include yourself in a simple conversion. This can be very difficult for lots of people because of things such as social anxiety along with other causes. A good trick to help with this is, to first of all be open-minded, whatever topic is being spoken about just join in and be a part of the conversation. YOU have to include yourself because if you don’t, I know from experience I can tell you that no one else will. Don’t be scared of what other people might think, because if they judge you for simply being engaging in a conversation, they aren’t worth your time anyway. </p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #2 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p calign="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
If the reason why you’re feeling this way is because you don’t have a lot of friends, DON’T RUSH FRIENDHIPS. I know it can be hard to make friends, trust me I know from experience, but it’s better to take your time to find the people that etch match your energy than to be with a group of  people you can’t be yourself with. I suggest you try to follow them on social media and see from there, you can kind of see their lives and what they like, which will give you a rough aspect to what they’re life looks like. If you think that your energy matches with that person thenbe BOLD and make the first move for a friendship to begin. You can start by texting through any sort of social media and as you get more comfortable then when your country lowers the restricvtions you can even hang out with them in person.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #3 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
If the reason why you’re feeling excluded from your community has anything to do with the fact that you have actually been diagnosed with social anxiety, then you should probably start small, go see a psychologist or therapist so they can help you better than I ever could with my tips. If it’s of any help however, or you simply can’t affor to go see a therapist or psychologist, then you can seek help from some youtube channels that are the second best option when dealing with this kind of stuff.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #4 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
To include yourself in a conversation a really important factor to keep in mind is to ALWAYS have eye contact because eye contact shows interest and it keeps the conversation from being awkward. Apart from all this it also keeps the conversation going and shows the other person that you are interested in what they’re saying. This could potentially lead to a friendship and who knows maybe you just made a new friend from simple eye contact. It’s the little things that matter at the end of the day, and it’s a facts that people like to talk about themselves, so by proving to someone that you are istwnig and engaged in what they’re saying, you are pretty much showing and displaying to them you’re listening skills and engaging skills which are key in a healthy friendship were both people feel welcome  and included. This friendship could potentially later on lead to a bigger friend group and even more inclusion in the community.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #5 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p calign="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
If what you struggle with is the feeling that others might judge you and that’s reason why you don’t feel so included or simply don’t want to include yourself in your community, then always remember the following. Most people that you are scared might judge, won’t matter at all, in a maximum of 5 years, abd anyways, who are they to judge, they don’t know your life, they don’t know what you do everyday. So if they ever do judge you just ignore them, because what they’re saying is probably fake anyways. This will hopefully help you see that you shouldn’t be afraid to include yourself in a conversation or your community  because those people you’re so afraid of don’t matter, and shouldn’t matter to you.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #6 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
Try to go slow once again, if you aren’t comfortable with people and that’s the reason you feel excluded, tell people. You shouldn’t be alone in this and if you  are afraid of someone for valid reasons you should tell, don’t be afraid to be called a snitch, your fear is valid, because if you feel uncomfortable there has got to be something wrong going on. If the reason why you are fraid however is not very valid, try to ask yourself why it is you feel this way, if it’s simply because you don’t know that person much you can maybe get to know them a little bit better and see from there. This will hopefully get rid of your fear and will finlly allow you to be more open in your community. </p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #7 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
To include yourself in a conversation there is one key thing to keep in mind that is barely talked about when this topic is brought up. This is that you should always try and keep the conversation going. To include yourself in a conversation a helpful tip is to always try and push it more, and a good plus is to be funny, because people tend to like it/find more entertaining when they laugh, which will make them want to keep on talking to you. This will hopefully help you include yourself more in the conversation which will hopefully learn to you feeling more included in your community. </p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px">Tip #8 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px">
In order to include yourself more in your community, something you can do is sign up for activities, here you will be killing two birds with one shot as you will be both building up confidence in your community, and getting to know more people. These activities you can usually find depending on your community, if you’re trying to include yourself in your school community then maybe you could join after school activities. If you’re trying to include yourself in your work community however you could sign up for team building activities that are usually offered, you can probably talk to HR about that and find out when’s the next one you can sign up for. If you’re trying to include yourself in your neighbourhood community however, you can maybe go to events, or if they don’t do any events then maybe you could organize one yourself. </p>
